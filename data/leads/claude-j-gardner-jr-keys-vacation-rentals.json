They run on Guesty (migrated from LiveRez) for PMS and booking. Senior decision-makers above her are Claude Gardner (Broker/Partner) and Will Langley (CEO-level). Strongest personal hook: Hana's bio mentions the island lifestyle — beach and kayaking — which connects to Sam's surfing and fishing background.",

Stuff gets missed — a stain on a couch, a cracked tile, a missing set of towels — and it doesn't surface until the next guest checks in and leaves a bad review. We built a tool that plugs right into Guesty and automatically flags damage and missing items from the photos your cleaners are already taking. No workflow change on their end.
