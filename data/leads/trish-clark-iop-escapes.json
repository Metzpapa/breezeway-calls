The company grew from 16 to 64 properties since 2021 with only 10 team members, and publicly commits to manager final checks before every check-in plus weekly physical inspections — a brutal workload at current scale. They run on OwnerRez as their PMS backbone, PriceLabs for pricing, and QuickBooks for accounting; no known inspection software, so quality checks are likely manual. Key names: Amy (co-owner, systems/bookings), Jeremy (ops lead), Sean Cradock (founder, cleaning background), Chris Basinger (VP Sales, part owner). Opener angle is industry proximity — Sam works with other vacation rental PM companies on inspection workflows along the East Coast.",
