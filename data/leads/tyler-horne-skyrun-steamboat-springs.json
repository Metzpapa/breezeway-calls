    "context": "Tyler Horne is the operations person at SkyRun Steamboat Springs — one of roughly two full-time staff managing about 36 vacation rentals in a premier Colorado ski market. He's listed alongside owner Megan Gutschenritter as a primary contact on property management directories, meaning he's likely the one executing turnovers, pre-arrival inspections, and guest support on a daily basis. SkyRun is a franchise network in the middle of a major tech-stack overhaul — Track PMS, PriceLabs, RemoteLock — but Steamboat has no confirmed inspection or photo-review tool. They explicitly promise pre-arrival inspections and professional cleaning every turnover to both owners and guests, and Tyler's tiny team has to actually deliver on that during peak ski season. Strongest hook: Sam skied Jackson Hole last month and works with other PMs in mountain resort markets.",
