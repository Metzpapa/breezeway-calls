    "context": "Brian Mello was just named President of Real Estate Sales and Broker-in-Charge at Dunes Properties in a March 2025 leadership transition alongside new COO Layne Kipp. His primary lane is real estate sales — not vacation rentals — but as Broker-in-Charge he has authority across the whole company including the ~183-unit Charleston Coast Vacations short-term rental program. Dunes explicitly does NOT employ housekeeping or maintenance staff; all turnovers are handled by third-party cleaning companies across Folly Beach, IOP, Wild Dunes, Sullivan's, and Kiawah. They run on TrackHS. If Brian isn't the right person, the warm referral targets are Liz Bernthal (VP Vacation Rentals), Layne Kipp (COO — operational efficiency mandate), or area directors Mark Malone (Folly Beach) and Fran Cote (IOP/Wild Dunes/Sullivan's). No direct personal connection with Sam — lead with congratulating him on the new President role from the March press release.",
