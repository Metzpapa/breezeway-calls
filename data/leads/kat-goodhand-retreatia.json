She's the front door for new property owners — Retreatia's growth pages literally say 'Reach out to Kat.' Prior role: Residence Manager and Owner Liaison at One Steamboat Place / Timbers Resorts (luxury), so she deeply understands high-end property standards and owner expectations. Retreatia manages roughly 240 units (77% condos), runs on TrackHS, and publicly promises 'a team of inspectors separate from cleaning after every guest' — that inspection promise is central to what Kat sells owners during onboarding. They're actively hiring a Housekeeping Supervisor and Owner Liaison right now, signaling scaling strain on QA. No direct shared connections with Sam, but Sam skied Jackson Hole last month — Steamboat is a peer ski market and the closest natural bridge.",
