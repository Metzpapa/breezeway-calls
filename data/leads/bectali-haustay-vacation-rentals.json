She is NOT the decision maker for tooling. The buyers are Nick Foster (Founder/President), Elisa Foster (Founder/VP), or Agostina Baldi (Director of Hospitality, ex-Vacasa). Haustay runs Streamline PMS + PriceLabs, promises a clean-then-inspect process after every guest stay, and leadership has publicly stated they want 'automation on all processes in order to scale.' The goal of this call is to be respectful of Bectali's time, learn how inspections actually work on the ground from someone who lives it, and get referred up to whoever owns that process — most likely Agostina, Nick, or Elisa.",

The problem was their team was taking photos but nobody had time to actually review them all. Stuff was slipping through — a stain on a couch cushion, a missing throw blanket — and it'd show up in a guest review or an owner call instead of getting caught at the turnover. We built something that plugs into the photos your team's already taking and uses AI to flag anything that's off — damage, missing items, staging that doesn't match the baseline.
