She likely coordinates unit readiness between cleaners and turnover specialists and handles guest-reported issues day-to-day. The company already has dedicated turnover specialists inspecting after every stay, uses Track as their PMS, UpKeep for maintenance, and runs tight same-day turns (10AM out / 4PM in) across a dense oceanfront portfolio under increasing Oceanside STR permit caps. Key people above her: Peter Rodriguez (Maintenance & Ops Manager), Iryna Djomins (Housekeeping Manager), David Fischbach (CEO/Owner).
