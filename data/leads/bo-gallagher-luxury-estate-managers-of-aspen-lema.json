He's the most junior ops person on the team — likely handles day-to-day turnover coordination and property readiness under multiple Property Managers. His bio isn't published yet, so there's almost zero personal intel. LEMA has ~10 staff: President Sarah Korpela, VP Britton Nieslanik, 7 Property Managers, and Bo. No known tech stack or PMS. Sam's strongest angle: he was just skiing in Jackson Hole in January 2026 and works with PMs in similar high-end mountain markets — natural peer energy. If Bo isn't the buyer, the referral targets are the PMs above him (Nathan, Chris, Dane, Joseph, Tara, Cameron) or leadership (Sarah, Britton). Calling Bo's direct cell: 970-309-4918.",
