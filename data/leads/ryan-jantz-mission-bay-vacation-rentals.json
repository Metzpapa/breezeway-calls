He co-leads with Ryan White (President) and has publicly enforced a zero-tolerance policy on noise complaints, signaling he's wired for operational controls and documentation. MBVR promises 'meticulously kept accommodations' and minutes-away response, but has no visible inspection software, and a July 2025 review called a unit 'disgusting' — a reputational risk signal at a time when San Diego's STRO licensing regime means any operational slip-up can threaten a license (Tier 4 Mission Beach waitlist reopens July 2025). Sam's connection: surfer from SoCal who's spent time at Mission Beach, now working with other SD-area vacation rental managers on inspection workflows.",
