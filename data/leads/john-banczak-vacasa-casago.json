    "context": "John Banczak is COO of Vacasa, now a Casago subsidiary after the May 2025 acquisition. He co-founded TurnKey Vacation Rentals — a tech-forward VR operator — so he thinks in systems and scale, not just hospitality. He was publicly quoted on Vacasa's Matterport rollout emphasizing guest expectations vs. reality, which maps directly to inspection quality. Vacasa already runs photo-based inspection approval at massive scale (43K+ homes, historically 15K daily turns) via their proprietary Field App and HomeCare Hub, but they cut 1,100+ roles in 2024 and are converting centralized markets to local franchise operators — meaning consistent quality is harder to maintain with less central oversight and more local variance. John lives in Steamboat Springs; Sam skied Jackson Hole last month. Lead with the mountain-market connection, then anchor the pain in the Casago franchise transition and the photo-review bandwidth gap.",
