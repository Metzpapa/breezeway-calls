Penny Realty manages 500+ properties in San Diego across vacation rentals (missionbeach.com, uses Streamline PMS), long-term PM (pennyrealty.com, uses AppFolio), and real estate sales (coastalpro.com). They run a two-step turnover QC — contracted housekeepers clean, then a dedicated inspector verifies every unit — and recently posted a job for a Vacation Rental Home Inspector citing rapid growth. No named inspection ops platform publicly visible. Sam's strongest connection is SoCal roots (grew up in LA, surfs) and work with other San Diego-area property managers.",

Inspector's moving fast, maybe they miss a scuff behind a door or a stain on a couch that wasn't there yesterday. Then a guest checks in and flags it, or worse — an owner sees it on their next visit and now it's a whole conversation about who's responsible and when it happened. I saw you guys just rolled out that Homeowner Protection Program with the million-dollar coverage — which is smart — but even with that, you still need the documentation to actually back up a claim.
