She's publicly quoted in a RemoteLock case study describing the painful move from SkyRun's legacy PMS to Track and emphasizing the need for modern integrations. SkyRun is mid-stack-overhaul right now: Track PMS, PriceLabs for revenue management, RemoteLock for access control — and they're targeting 350 new doors by end of 2025. The strongest hook: she's already championed three major tool rollouts, RapidEye plugs directly into Track, and the TIDY case study shows at least one SkyRun location actively upgrading their cleaning/inspection ops tool. Sam's ski connection (Jackson Hole, Jan 2026) maps naturally to SkyRun's ski-resort market focus.",
