In August 2025, they took on 150+ homes previously managed by Vacasa — a massive portfolio expansion that is almost certainly straining their turnover and inspection workflows right now. They run on Streamline PMS with Property Care X for field ops, publicly promise 75-point cleaning checklists and monthly 100-point inspections, and Casago corporate just partnered with Breezeway network-wide. Bert's bio says he loves the beach, ocean, and sports — Sam surfs and grew up in LA, so lead with the SoCal ocean connection to open warm.",
