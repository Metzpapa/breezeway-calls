    "context": "Alexander Vega is General Manager at Oranj Palm Vacation Homes — the vacation rental arm of Palm Springs Rental Agency, operating since 1972 in the Coachella Valley. He has 18+ years of management experience and oversees cross-functional operations including their QA department, maintenance, and turnover workflows across 100+ properties on Track PMS. They already use OpenAI on their website for review summarization so they're not AI-averse, but no inspection platform like Breezeway is confirmed — that's the gap. February is peak season in Palm Springs, meaning turnover volume and QA pressure are at their highest right now. Sam's angle is SoCal native — grew up in the LA area, knows the desert market — and credibility from working with similar vacation rental operators.",
