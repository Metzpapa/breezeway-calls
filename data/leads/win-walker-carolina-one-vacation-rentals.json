They run Breezeway for turnover checklists, Streamline as their PMS, and Beyond for owner reporting. Their model is inspection-heavy: property managers do pre-arrival inspections on every check-in day and promise owners that every room is checked so nothing is missed. They are actively scaling — new Johns Island office opened in 2024, hiring PMs through Better Talent, approaching 400 units. Win is the primary operational decision-maker: listed as BBB business contact, tied to the vacation rentals Operations Center. No direct personal connection to Sam, but strong industry fit — Sam works with similar-scale VR operators on inspection AI, and Win's entire operation is built around the exact workflow RapidEye automates.",
