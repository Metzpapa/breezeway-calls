Their site explicitly mentions inspections of cleaning staff and performance reviews, and they serve physician property owners — both direct RapidEye hooks. No known PMS or ops platform; unit count unknown but likely small. Strongest connection: Sam's parents are both physicians in LA, and Kathy's company specifically manages properties for physician owners. Key market context: Maui's Bill 9 (passed Dec 2025) is phasing out ~6,200 vacation rentals by 2029-2031 — regulatory pressure is high and documentation matters more than ever.",
