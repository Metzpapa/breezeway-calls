    "context": "Allen Kleckley is a General Manager at Vacasa overseeing the Edisto Beach, SC market — a smaller coastal vacation rental destination where he's publicly flagged limited local contractor availability as a major operational constraint. He owns turnover execution, cleaning inspections, maintenance dispatch, and local team management. Vacasa was acquired by Casago in May 2025 and is migrating to a franchise model with new ops tools (Breezeway, Guesty) rolling network-wide, so Allen's workflows and systems are likely in flux. Vacasa's field app already includes post-cleaning photo submissions with real-time inspection approval gates — the exact workflow RapidEye attaches to. No direct personal connection to Sam — lean on industry proximity with other East Coast coastal GMs and the beach-market angle.",
