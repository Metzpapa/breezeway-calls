    "context": "Scott Hudson is the Maintenance Department Manager at Island Realty — he runs 'Isle Fix It,' their in-house maintenance team covering 300+ vacation rentals across Isle of Palms, Wild Dunes, and Sullivan's Island. He owns the maintenance queue and dispatch, so every damage issue missed during a turnover lands on his team as an emergency guest call or reactive repair. Island Realty runs Escapia (PMS), NAVIS (reservations), Key Data (benchmarking), and YapStone (payments), but has no confirmed inspection or photo-analysis platform — meaning there's likely a gap between housekeeping turnovers and maintenance awareness. Peak season is approaching fast, and they just ran shoulder-season promos (15–25% off through May) to fill occupancy, which means turn volume is about to spike. Best angle: lead with working with other coastal PM maintenance teams in the Charleston market — Sam surfs and fishes barrier-island coastline, so the connection to Isle of Palms is natural but don't force it.",
