She owns the brand promise of 'meticulous inspection' across Isle of Palms, Folly Beach, Kiawah, and Seabrook with a small coordination team (Office Manager Megan Corn, Ops Manager Hunter Ray, plus contracted cleaners, inspectors, and maintenance vendors). Steven is also President of the iTrip Franchise Association, meaning a win here could open the door to the entire iTrip network. They already invest in property tech (NoiseAware, Minut, Kaba smart locks) and iTrip's platform supports a Breezeway integration — though it's unconfirmed whether Charleston Beaches is actively using it. No personal connection to Sam found; lead with East Coast vacation rental PM work and Charleston beach market proximity.",
