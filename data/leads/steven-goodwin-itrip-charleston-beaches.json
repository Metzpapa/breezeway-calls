Steven leads revenue management and guest services, and is also President of the iTrip Franchise Association, giving him influence across the entire iTrip network. His background is enterprise hospitality — former Managing Director at Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos, CEO of Hard Rock Park, board roles at Universal Orlando and Universal Studios Japan. The operation is lean but promises professional cleaning and meticulous inspection on every turnover, with a small office team (ops manager Hunter Ray, office manager Megan Corn) coordinating a network of cleaners, inspectors, and vendors via Slack and Google Drive. No direct personal connection to Sam — lead with Charleston market proximity and the franchise operator angle.",

But in reality — especially when summer hits and you've got back-to-back turns — nobody's catching everything. A stain slips through, a deck chair goes missing off the porch, something's cracked that wasn't cracked last week. Guest checks in, sees it, leaves a review about it.
