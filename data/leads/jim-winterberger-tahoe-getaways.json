No inspection or ops tech platform was found publicly — they likely run manual processes across the entire portfolio. Local competitor Lake Tahoe Accommodations (100+ units) already uses Breezeway. Sam's angle: works with similar vacation rental operators in mountain markets and was just skiing Jackson Hole — he knows this world firsthand.",
