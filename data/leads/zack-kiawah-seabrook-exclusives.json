He owns day-to-day field execution: vendor dispatch, punch lists, making sure every property is inspected and prepped after each cleaning. The company already runs a 25-point checklist with photo verification at every turnover and uses Track as their PMS. They were acquired by Continuum Management Group in 2021, so there is likely pressure to standardize quality reporting across the portfolio. Zack works under Director of Operations Ryan and GM Karen McFadden, alongside another Ops Manager named Chandler. His happy place is snow-covered Colorado mountains — Sam just skied Jackson Hole in January, which is a natural rapport hook if the conversation opens up.",
