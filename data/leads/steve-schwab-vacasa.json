He's navigating the biggest integration in vacation rental history: merging Vacasa's centralized tech stack (HomeCare Hub, post-clean photo approval workflows) with Casago's locally empowered franchise operators. Casago just partnered with Breezeway for ops and Guesty for PMS across the network, and expanded its San Diego franchise with 150+ former Vacasa homes in August 2025. Sam's SoCal roots, surfing background, and RapidEye's Breezeway integration create a natural entry point.",

But at that volume, stuff was slipping through — a stained sofa cushion, a cracked tile, a missing remote — and it'd show up in a guest review before anyone on his team even knew about it. Then the homeowner calls asking why they're paying management fees when nobody caught it. He said the worst part was they actually had the photos. Someone just didn't have time to look at them all.",

But when things do settle and you're looking at how to scale quality consistently across the franchise network — the people who move fastest are the ones who already know what's on their list. Would you be open to just seeing what it looks like? Even if it's just to see what other PM companies running forty thousand-plus homes are doing with their turnover photos. Worst case you steal some ideas and we part as friends.",
