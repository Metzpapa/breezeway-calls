She likely held a senior leadership position before stepping back and retains deep institutional influence. Resort Group is a major Steamboat Springs PM operation — 90+ associations, 5,000+ units, 600+ nightly rentals, ~240 peak-season employees, running on TrackHS, heavy use of H-2B seasonal labor. They recently exited their Texas property to refocus entirely on Steamboat. Strongest connection: Sam skied Jackson Hole in January 2026 — skiing is the natural shared world with someone embedded in Steamboat's resort economy.",

They're running a few hundred nightly rentals, seasonal staff cycling in and out, H-2B housekeepers — and the thing they kept running into was this: their cleaners were taking photos after every turn, uploading them into their PMS, but nobody actually had time to review all of them. So stuff would slip through — a gouge in a countertop, a missing set of towels, a broken drawer handle — and it wouldn't get caught until the next guest checked in and called the front desk on a Saturday night.
