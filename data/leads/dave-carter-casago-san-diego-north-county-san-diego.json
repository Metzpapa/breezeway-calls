He and co-owners Bert King and Erik Trogden just absorbed 150+ coastal vacation rental homes from Vacasa in mid-August 2025 — a massive operational scaling event happening right now. They run on Streamline PMS and Property Care X for field ops, publicly promise 75-point cleaning checklists and monthly 100-point inspections across high-end properties from Oceanside to La Jolla. Casago corporate is also rolling out Breezeway and Guesty across the franchise network, putting them in an active tech consolidation cycle through early 2026. Sam's angle: both SoCal guys, Dave's into outdoor activities and sports, Sam grew up in LA and surfs — and Sam works with other coastal property managers on exactly this inspection scaling problem.",
