He co-leads with Ryan Jantz (Owner); the company has been around since 2003. They promise 'meticulously kept accommodations' and 'minutes' response times with a high-touch local team — but have no known inspection software or PMS. A July 2025 review called a unit 'disgusting,' and San Diego's STRO licensing regime is tightening (fee changes March 2025, Tier 4 waitlist reopening July 2025). Sam connection: Sam surfs and grew up in SoCal — Mission Beach is a surf mecca, and Ryan runs the rental operation right on the beach. Easy rapport opener.",

Now they're issuing a refund, sending someone over in a panic, and there's a one-star review going up.
