    "context": "Cynthia 'Cindy' Nesello is in Operations at Grand Welcome Palm Springs, a full-service STR management company in the Coachella Valley with in-house housekeeping, maintenance, and pre-arrival spot-checks. She's a deeply experienced hospitality operator — born in San Diego, lived in Florianópolis, Brazil for 22 years running restaurants, a boutique hotel, and an eco-sport facility before returning to the US in 2016. The owner is Denise Turner, GM is Justin Marché, and Stacy Bottroff is also in Ops; all contacts route through the same shared phone and email. No public ops platform detected — Grand Welcome uses a proprietary reservation system at the brand level. Strongest connection to Sam: Cindy spent two decades in Florianópolis (one of Brazil's top surf destinations) and Sam is a surfer who just traveled to Indonesia and El Salvador for waves — plus both have SoCal roots.",
