He owns operational execution across 40,000+ vacation rental homes — turnovers, inspections, maintenance, field teams across hundreds of markets. He personally championed the Matterport digital twin partnership, publicly positioning visual tech as a standard for property management. His world right now is post-acquisition integration into Casago's franchise model, doing more with less after cutting ~800 roles, and pushing local autonomy while maintaining quality standards. Vacasa already runs post-clean photo submissions through their proprietary HomeCare Hub field app with a manual approval step — at their scale that means thousands of photos daily that someone is rubber-stamping. Sam's SoCal connection is the natural icebreaker — grew up in La Cañada (LA area), surfs regularly, and John is based in San Diego.",
