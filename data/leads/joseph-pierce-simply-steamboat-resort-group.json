He oversees structured housekeeping teams across 600+ nightly rental units — daily task lists, supervisor oversight, H-2B seasonal workers cycling in and out, and tight 10am-checkout / 4pm-check-in turnaround windows every day of the year. The company runs on TrackHS as their PMS, recently consolidated brands (Pioneer Ridge into Mountain Resorts), went through a leadership succession in 2024, and is laser-focused solely on Steamboat Springs after exiting their Texas property. No direct personal connection to Sam — strongest angle is industry proximity (Sam works with other resort housekeeping teams at similar scale) and a light skiing tie (Sam just skied Jackson Hole, Jan 2026).",
