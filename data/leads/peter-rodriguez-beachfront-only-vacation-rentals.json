His team supports Housekeeping, Construction, Long-term PM, and Sales, and they already employ dedicated turnover specialists who inspect after every single clean. Peter uses UpKeep as their CMMS and was featured in their Maintenance Hero Spotlight — he handles everything from missing blenders to dryer fires at 2 AM. Their PMS is Track. Company founded in 2000, owned by David Fischbach (CEO, ex-anesthesiologist, former Escapia/VRBO board member). Sam's angle: surfer from LA who hits Oceanside regularly — genuine SoCal coastal connection, and works with similar-scale PM companies on inspection automation.",
