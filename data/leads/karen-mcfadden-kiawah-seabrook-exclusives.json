She ran vacation rental ops at Vacasa/Avocet/Wyndham for 27 years before taking this GM role in Oct 2020, so she has seen everything. In 2021, Continuum Management Group acquired the business — Karen publicly praised the transition, but that parent-company layer means tool decisions may need corporate buy-in. They use Track (TrackHS) as their PMS and already run a 25-point checklist with photo verification on every turnover, which means they are generating massive photo volume that is hard to review manually. RapidEye integrates directly into Track — that is the zero-friction hook. No strong personal connection to Sam — lead with working with other Charleston-area PM companies on inspection workflows.",

A stain on a sofa in one of the oceanfront homes, a cracked screen door, a missing set of towels — and it doesn't surface until the guest calls in or the owner shows up and sees it.
