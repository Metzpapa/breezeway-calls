    "context": "Calling Tim Newman, Owner/Broker of Gold Star Vacation Rentals — a boutique vacation rental PM in Gulf Shores & Orange Beach, AL. Tim is the final decision-maker on operational tooling and owner relations. Gold Star's entire brand is built on being 'the cleanest' with 'white glove treatment' and thorough inspections — that's their competitive edge against giants like Brett/Robinson (1,700 units) and Vacasa/Meyer (980 units). They use Streamline as their PMS (owner portal confirmed). Key ops person is someone named 'Ande' who handles day-to-day owner and turnover coordination. Sam's connection: industry proximity on the Gulf Coast, and Sam is a lifelong fisherman (founded his HS fishing club) — Gulf Shores is one of the top fishing destinations in the country. Use the fishing angle as a rapport builder if the conversation warms up. If someone other than Tim answers, jump to the someone_else_answers node.",
