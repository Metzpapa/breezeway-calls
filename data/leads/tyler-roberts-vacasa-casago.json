    "context": "Tyler Roberts is Senior Regional Director of Operations at Vacasa (now a Casago subsidiary as of May 2025), based in Steamboat Springs, CO. He likely owns guest-readiness KPIs and cleaner performance across multiple mountain resort markets — the person whose phone rings when a guest checks into a problem. Vacasa already captures post-clean photos via their proprietary Field App and reviews them through HomeCare Hub, but after 800+ layoffs in 2024 and markets converting to Casago franchise operators, the human review layer is stretched thin and consistency is harder to enforce. The company manages roughly 43,000 homes combined and historically processed 15,000+ daily housekeeping schedules. Sam's strongest hook: you just skied Jackson Hole in January — Tyler lives and works in Steamboat Springs, both mountain resort markets.",

So stuff would slip through — a stain on the couch, missing towels, a broken blind — and the first person to catch it was the guest. Then it's a fire drill at 4 PM on a Saturday and he's the one getting the call. We built something that automatically reviews those turnover photos the second they're uploaded — catches damage, missing items, staging issues — before a guest ever checks in.
