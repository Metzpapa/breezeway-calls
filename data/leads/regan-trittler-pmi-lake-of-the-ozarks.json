He's the final decision-maker and is personally listed as host on Vrbo and Airbnb properties. His ops team includes Candice Reimers (GM) and Chrissy Osteen (Ops & Guest Relations). They run Booking Automation as their PMS and PriceLabs for dynamic pricing, heavily market smart-home tech and photo documentation during inspections, but have no AI or dedicated inspection QA tool. Strongest hook to Sam: Regan's Vrbo listings describe his properties as an 'angler's paradise' with fishing tournament references — Sam founded a fishing club in high school and is an avid fisherman.",
