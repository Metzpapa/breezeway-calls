    "context": "Chris Basinger is VP of Sales and part owner at IOP Escapes, a luxury vacation rental operator on Isle of Palms, SC managing 64 properties with a 10-person team. His job is signing new homeowners into the portfolio — he specifically chose IOP Escapes because of their manager-inspection-before-every-check-in promise and contractor relationships. That inspection promise is getting harder to keep: they have grown from 16 to 64 units since 2021 and publicly commit to weekly physical inspections plus manager final checks before every guest arrival. They run on OwnerRez with PriceLabs for pricing and distribute across Airbnb, Vrbo, and Expedia. Chris also sells real estate at St. Germain Properties (direct cell 843-922-0222). Strongest angle: the inspection quality he pitches to prospective owners is exactly what breaks at scale — and protecting that promise protects his sales pipeline.",

And the thing they kept running into is — they're promising their homeowners that a manager personally inspects every property before check-in. Same kind of promise you guys make on Isle of Palms. But when you're running 64 homes with a team of ten, and it's peak season, and you've got back-to-back turnovers on a Saturday — somebody's scrolling through hundreds of cleaner photos on their phone between properties, somebody's driving all over the island doing walkthroughs, and things still slip through. Guest checks in, there's a stain on the sofa nobody caught, or the grill on the deck is still dirty from last weekend. Now you've got a three-star review on a property you're trying to pitch to the next homeowner. And for you specifically — you're the one out there signing those owners. That gold-standard inspection promise is a big part of your pitch. Does any of that sound familiar, or am I totally off base?",
        "note": "PAUSE after the question. Do not fill the silence. Let Chris react. The pain is tailored to his VP of Sales role — inspection failures undermine the exact promises he uses to acquire new owners. 'Gold standard' is their own language from their website.
