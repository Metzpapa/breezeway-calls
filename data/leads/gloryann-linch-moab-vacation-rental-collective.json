    "context": "Calling Gloryann Linch — Co-Owner and Managing Partner of the Moab market for Vacation Rental Collective (BookVRC). She owns the P&L for 42+ units across Rim Village, Coyote Run, and downtown Moab in one of the highest-turnover adventure markets in the country. Before VRC she was a Project Specialist at Mountain Capital Partners running CapEx and resort development for Purgatory Resort — she understands that scaling operations requires systems, not just more people. Her bio emphasizes efficiency, consistency, and meticulous attention to detail. VRC operates as a collective where local partners own their markets under a central corporate structure — CEO is Mary Beth Miles in Durango, ops director is Levi Lloyd — so Gloryann likely has autonomy for Moab but may need corporate for bigger decisions. Strongest Sam connection: shared outdoor-adventure world — Sam skis, fishes, surfs; Gloryann came from the ski resort industry and runs properties in a national park market. Direct number: 801-513-3299.",
