She has 30+ years in property management with a background in business administration, leadership, and marketing. Her team runs in-house housekeeping, maintenance, and does spot-checks and top-to-bottom inspections before guests arrive. Grand Welcome is a franchise brand (750+ properties nationwide as of 2022) with a proprietary reservation system; no public PMS or ops platform was found for the Palm Springs location, and unit count is unknown. Strongest Sam connection: both are SoCal natives — Sam grew up in La Cañada (LA area), Denise operates in the Coachella Valley. Secondary hook: Sam's parents are physicians, Denise has chaired walks for the Alzheimer's Association.",
