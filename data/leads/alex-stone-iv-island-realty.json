    "context": "Alex Stone IV is CEO of Island Realty, a family-owned vacation rental company managing 300+ properties across Isle of Palms, Wild Dunes, Sullivan's Island, and Goat Island near Charleston, SC. Multi-generational Stone family business — his father Sandy owns it, brother Eric is Director of Hospitality. They run in-house housekeeping (Isle Clean It) and maintenance (Isle Fix It), use Escapia as their PMS, NAVIS for reservations, and Key Data for benchmarking — but there is no publicly confirmed inspection or photo-analysis platform. Currently pushing shoulder-season promos and just rolled out a new cancellation policy for 2026. Strongest angle: Sam works with similar-sized coastal PM companies on the East Coast, and if redirected, Collins Atkinson (Dir of Property Mgmt, 843-242-1076) or Alex Lane (Housekeeping Dept Mgr, 843-242-1070) are the ops owners to reach.",

His team was taking photos after every clean, but with that many units flipping, especially heading into summer, nobody actually had time to look through every photo from every turn. So issues were just getting buried until they became a guest review or a five-hundred-dollar argument about who caused the damage.",
