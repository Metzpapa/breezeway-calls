CBMM manages roughly 300 properties across the Roaring Fork Valley and explicitly markets pre-arrival and post-departure inspections to property owners. No known inspection tech platform. Justin is not the top decision-maker — Will Herndon (President) oversees all company operations — but Justin is close enough to the rental process to either engage or refer internally. Sam's angle: he was just skiing Jackson Hole a few weeks ago and Justin lives and works in Aspen ski country.",

So a scratch on a custom dining table, a stain on a ten-thousand-dollar sofa — it wouldn't get caught until the owner noticed. And by then you can't charge the guest, and now you've got an owner questioning whether you're actually protecting their property. We built an AI that plugs into whatever system your team's already using and automatically flags damage, missing items, staging issues from the photos they're already taking.

But I've been working with a bunch of PM companies in high-end ski markets, and I could walk you through what they're doing on the inspection side — what's working, what's not. Worst case you pick up a couple ideas for your own process and we part as friends. Would that be worth 15 minutes?",
