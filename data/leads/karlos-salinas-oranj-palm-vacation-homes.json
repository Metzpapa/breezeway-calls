He owns all day-to-day management operations and came up through communications and marketing (CSU San Bernardino). They run Track PMS, have a dedicated QA department and maintenance crew, and already use OpenAI on their site for guest review summarization — so they're tech-forward, but no inspection platform like Breezeway has been detected. Their biggest local competitor, ACME House Company, already runs Breezeway and Matterport. Strongest Sam connection: both SoCal natives — Sam grew up in the LA area, Karlos is in the desert — and Sam works with similar PM operators in comparable markets.",
