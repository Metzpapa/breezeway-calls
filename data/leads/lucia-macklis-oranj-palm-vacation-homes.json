So stuff was slipping. A cracked pool tile here, a missing blender there, cigarette burn on a patio cushion. And they wouldn't find out until a guest left a one-star review or an owner called asking why their couch has a stain on it. The photos were there the whole time — they just couldn't humanly review that volume. Does any of that sound familiar, or is your world totally different?",
