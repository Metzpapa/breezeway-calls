    "context": "Agostina Baldi is Director of Hospitality at Haustay Vacation Rentals — she almost certainly owns turnover quality, cleaner standards, and guest-readiness across their ~50-60 coastal North County San Diego properties. She came from Vacasa as a Property Specialist, so she's seen large-scale ops and knows what breaks. Haustay runs Streamline PMS, PriceLabs, in-house cleaners (Vanessa, Bectali, Emily), and explicitly inspects after every stay — but has no known photo/inspection platform. Leadership has publicly said they want 'automation on all processes to scale.' Strongest angle: she's the one who feels it when something slips between the clean and the guest walking in. Sam's in: surfer, grew up in LA, works with other San Diego coastal PMs.",
