    "context": "Mark Ruda is VP at Thousand Hills Vacations — a family-run Branson operation managing 300-500+ units across 12 buildings and complexes. He's a licensed P.E. who came from consulting engineering in Kansas City and moved to Branson in 2002 to work the development side. His father Daniel C. Ruda is the owner. They run Streamline as their PMS but have no detected inspection or photo-review platform like Breezeway. Their terms and conditions explicitly reference charging guests for damage and replacements — meaning missed issues cost them real money. Strongest angle: Sam works with other Streamline-based vacation rental operators in the Branson market, and Mark's engineering background will resonate with a systems-level pitch about standardizing quality across hundreds of units.",
