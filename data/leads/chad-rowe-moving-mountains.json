They run Breezeway for field ops and Track as their PMS. Just took investment from StayTerra (May 2025) and have been growing through acquisitions (Triumph Mountain Properties, Paragon Lodging). As COO, Chad owns cross-market operational consistency, which is under real pressure from all that growth and integration. They staff dedicated QA inspector roles in every market and promise owners detailed pre-arrival and post-stay inspections. Sam skied Jackson Hole in January — natural connection to a luxury ski-town operator. Strongest technical angle: AI photo analysis layering on top of the Breezeway and Track stack they already use, zero workflow change.",

Stuff would slip through — a stain on a sofa, a scratch on a dining table, a missing throw blanket — and at their nightly rates, that kind of miss turns into a one-star review and an angry owner call.
