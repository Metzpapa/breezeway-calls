    "context": "Dan Douglas is Director of Association Management at Retreatia — a ~250-unit, 77%-condo vacation rental and HOA management company in Steamboat Springs, CO. He oversees multiple condo associations, meaning he deals with HOA boards demanding accountability on unit condition, coordinates between rental ops and association rules, and influences how inspections and maintenance standards are enforced across complexes. Retreatia runs TRACK as their PMS, explicitly promises a separate inspection team after every clean, and is actively hiring a Housekeeping Supervisor and Owner Liaison — signals of operational strain. No personal overlap with Sam, but Sam skied Jackson Hole last month and works with PM companies in similar ski markets. Dan can either champion better condition documentation across his associations or connect Sam to whoever runs ops and housekeeping — likely GM Viktorija Hristovska.",
