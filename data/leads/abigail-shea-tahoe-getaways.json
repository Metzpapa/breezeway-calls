She likely owns turnover workflows, cleaner coordination, inspection quality, and catching issues before guests arrive — exactly where RapidEye fits. No inspection or photo analysis platform was found publicly, so they are probably running manual checklists or a homegrown process. Her boss is Jim Winterberger, Founder and President, who would greenlight new tooling. Strongest connection to Sam: California-based, just went skiing at Jackson Hole weeks ago, and works with PM operators in mountain vacation rental markets — open with Tahoe market proximity.",
