Their vacation rental side runs a two-step turnover QC — contracted housekeepers clean, then a dedicated inspector verifies every unit — so they already feel the pain of missed issues at scale. They use Streamline as their PMS, just launched a $1M Homeowner Protection Program via RentalGuardian, and are actively hiring inspectors due to rapid growth. VP/CFO Shayne Flaherty is Greg's family; Rebekah Gonzalez is the Business Administrator and likely gatekeeper. Sam's in: both SoCal guys — Sam surfs and grew up in LA, Greg's company operates on Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla.",
