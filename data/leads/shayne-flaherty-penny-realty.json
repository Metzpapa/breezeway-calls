She oversees HR, training, and corporate accounting — she controls both the budget and staff performance standards. Greg Flaherty (President/CEO) is family; Hunter Curtis and Cole Holderman run vacation rental ops. They use contracted housekeepers with a dedicated inspector doing post-checkout verification but have no named ops/photo platform — that is the gap. Tech stack: Streamline (vacation PMS), AppFolio (long-term), DocuSign, Akia, RentalGuardian/InsureStays. They just launched a Homeowner Protection Program for damage and liability — documentation quality is the weak link. Strongest hook for Sam: geographic proximity (LA native, spends time in San Diego), working with other SD-area vacation rental managers, and surfing culture overlap with the Mission Beach team.",

A cracked countertop, a missing chair cushion, a stain that wasn't there before checkout. And every one of those is either a deposit you can't claim, a damage dispute the owner calls about, or something your protection program can't cover because it wasn't documented in time. We built a tool that plugs into the photos your inspectors are already taking — flags damage, missing items, staging issues — automatically. No workflow change on their end.
