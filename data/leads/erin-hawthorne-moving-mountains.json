    "context": "Erin Hawthorne is the Operations Manager for Beaver Creek & Vail at Moving Mountains — a luxury vacation rental PM company running ~250 high-end properties across four Colorado ski markets (Steamboat, Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge). She owns day-to-day turnover coordination, QA oversight, and maintenance dispatch in the Vail Valley, which grew significantly after the Triumph Mountain Properties acquisition in late 2023. Moving Mountains uses Breezeway for field ops and Track as their PMS, and StayTerra just invested in the company (May 2025), adding pressure to standardize across markets. Sam's angle: he's a skier who recently hit Jackson Hole, and he works with other Breezeway-connected luxury PMs — RapidEye plugs into Breezeway, not replaces it.",

A stain on a sofa nobody noticed, a nick on a cabinet, a set of towels that didn't get restocked — and nobody catches it until the guest walks in. And at the rate your guests are paying for a place in Beaver Creek, one miss turns into a one-star review and an owner calling you wondering what happened. We built a tool that plugs right into Breezeway and automatically flags damage, missing items, staging issues from the photos your team's already taking — zero workflow change on their end. Would you be open to taking a look at it when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue?",
