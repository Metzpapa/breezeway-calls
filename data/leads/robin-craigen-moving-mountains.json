He's the strategic leader who publicly champions culture, selective hiring, and luxury benchmarks like privacy and hyper-personalization. The company just took investment from StayTerra (May 2025), acquired Triumph Mountain Properties (Dec 2023), and is actively scaling with pressure to standardize QA across four markets — they run on Track PMS and Breezeway, with dedicated QA inspector roles in every market. They promise owners detailed prearrival and post-stay inspections, bi-annual maintenance inspections, and asset protection — these are operational deliverables where misses cost owners. Sam's hook: he just skied Jackson Hole last month and has been working with luxury property managers in Colorado ski country.",
