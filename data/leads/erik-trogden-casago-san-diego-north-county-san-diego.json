    "context": "Erik Trogden is one of three partner/owners at Casago San Diego / North County San Diego — a Casago franchise managing high-end coastal vacation rentals across Oceanside, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Del Mar, and La Jolla. They just absorbed 150+ homes from Vacasa in August 2025, which means they're onboarding a massive batch of properties with new cleaners who don't know the units yet — massive QA strain. They run Streamline PMS with Property Care X for field ops and publicly promise homeowners 75-point cleaning checklists and monthly 100-point inspections, which gets exponentially harder to honor at this new scale. Erik was quoted in the 2023 franchise launch about growth and responsible operations, suggesting he's the systems-minded partner among the three (Dave Carter and Bert King are the other two). Sam's angle: SoCal native who grew up in LA and spends time in North County — geographic proximity is the strongest natural connection, plus shared entrepreneurial background.",
