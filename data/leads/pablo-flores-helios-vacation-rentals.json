    "context": "Pablo Flores is CEO and co-owner of Helios Vacation Rentals — a luxury STR management company in Greater Palm Springs with 32 properties. He founded Helios because he was dissatisfied with other managers' cleanliness and attention to detail. The company runs in-house cleaning plus dedicated inspection and ops roles: Rosana Castro (Inspections Manager), Marcela De Dios (Operations Manager), and Erin Tsu (COO/co-owner). They use Hostaway as their PMS, Safely.com for damage waivers ($1,500 cap), and noise sensors — but no inspection platform like Breezeway was detected. Sam's strongest connection: both are SoCal natives — Sam grew up near Pasadena in La Cañada Flintridge, Helios operates in the desert just east of LA, and the Coachella/Stagecoach festival overlap is a natural in since Sam ran an event promotion business in high school.",
