She co-founded with Robin Craigen (CEO) and controls the financial side: budgets, damage costs, inspection staffing, owner retention economics. They just took investment from StayTerra (May 2025), have been acquiring aggressively (Triumph Mountain Properties in Vail, Paragon Lodging in Breck), and staff dedicated QA inspectors in every market. Confirmed tech: Breezeway for ops, Track for PMS. Sam's ski connection (Jackson Hole last month) and co-founder-to-co-founder framing are the strongest hooks. If she defers, route to Chad Rowe (COO) or Lisa Riniker (Director of Ops).",
