As a PM she lives in the turnover workflow every day — scheduling cleans, reviewing photos, catching damage, fielding guest complaints when something slips. The company runs on Streamline as their PMS and AppFolio on the long-term rental side; no public evidence of Breezeway or Matterport. Key decision-makers above her are Kelly McLean Lewin (COO / publicly described as CEO) and Michael McLean (Broker/Owner). Sam's strongest connection: he grew up in La Cañada — two hours from Palm Springs — and works with other PMs managing similar-sized vacation rental portfolios in the area.",
