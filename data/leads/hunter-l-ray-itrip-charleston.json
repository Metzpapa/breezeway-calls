Their brand promise is 'sparkling clean, well-maintained, impeccably staged' — Hunter is the person who has to deliver on that every single turnover. No strong personal connection to Sam — lead with working with other property managers in Charleston beach rentals and lean hard on knowing they use FlipStream.",
