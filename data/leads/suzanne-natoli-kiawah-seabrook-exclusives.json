She has 15+ years in vacation rentals and owns the rental revenue projection pitch to prospective owners. The company manages 185+ vacation rentals (115+ Kiawah, 70+ Seabrook) from Johns Island, SC, acquired by Continuum Management Group in 2021, running on Track PMS with a 25-point turnover checklist and photo verification already in place. Strongest angle for Sam: RapidEye gives Suzanne a tangible owner-acquisition differentiator — AI-generated inspection reports she can put in front of prospective owners as proof of care, especially when competing against bigger Charleston operators like Stay Duvet (360+) and Island Realty (350+). No direct personal connection to Sam — lead with industry proximity and the Charleston coastal PM market.",
