He likely manages integrations, device rollouts, and vendor enablement for their confirmed stack: Track (PMS) and Breezeway (ops platform). Moving Mountains just took investment from StayTerra (May 2025), is actively integrating acquisitions, and staffs dedicated QA inspectors across markets generating high volumes of turnover photos. Daniel is not the ops decision-maker — the goal is to engage him on the integration angle or get a warm referral to Lisa Riniker (Dir of Ops), Liz Piazza (Systems Admin), or Chad Rowe (COO).

It's just sitting there. And then when something gets missed — a stain on a sofa in a luxury home, a piece of art that's gone, a hot tub cover that's cracked — it turns into a fire drill, and somehow IT gets pulled into the 'can we pull this up' or 'can we build a report' conversation. We built something that plugs directly into Breezeway and Track and automatically analyzes every photo for damage, missing items, staging issues — no workflow change for your ops team, no new app for your cleaners or QA inspectors. Would you be open to taking a look at some point when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue?",

The thing we keep hearing from other Breezeway customers is that the photos go in, but nobody actually reviews all of them. It's just too many images across too many units. We sit on top of Breezeway — same photos, same upload process, but now every image gets analyzed automatically and issues get flagged before they become a guest problem. Is that something your ops team has brought up at all, or is the photo review piece working fine as-is?",
