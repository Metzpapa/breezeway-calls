Based in Cannon Beach, OR with HQ in Scottsdale, AZ. They use Guesty as their franchise PMS, have active Breezeway relationships in some locations, and just hired a Chief Digital Officer (David Angotti, Nov 2025) to roll out AI-powered tools across the network. Their Cannon Beach property management page explicitly advertises 'photos with every work order.' Strongest hook for Sam: Cannon Beach is a premier Oregon coast surf town and Sam is a dedicated surfer — plus Casago's franchise model at 40K units creates exactly the distributed inspection quality problem RapidEye solves.",
