Casago completed a merger with Vacasa in May 2025, acquired Naya Homes in June 2025, and announced a strategic partnership with Breezeway for property operations in August 2025, meaning they are actively scaling and building out their ops tech stack right now. Key ops leaders below Steve: Jose Romero (Director of Ops), Wes Melton (CTO), Judi Crane (AZ General Manager). The strongest hook is the Breezeway partnership — RapidEye plugs directly into Breezeway, and Casago's rapid post-merger growth creates the exact quality-control gap RapidEye solves. No direct personal connection to Sam — lead with the Breezeway announcement as the bridge.",
