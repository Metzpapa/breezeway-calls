    "context": "Brian Brown is Director of Business Development at Grand Welcome Palm Springs — a locally owned Grand Welcome franchise doing full-service STR management in the Coachella Valley. He has 20+ years in vacation rentals, real estate, and banking, and focuses on market understanding and homeowner relationships. His role makes him the vendor-evaluation gatekeeper — he likely routes operational tooling decisions to Denise Turner (Owner), Justin Marché (GM), or Stacy Bottroff (Ops). The company does spot checks before guest arrival and top-to-bottom inspections after cleaning with in-house teams, but has no publicly visible ops platform or Matterport. Sam's best angle: he's from the LA area calling into Palm Springs, works with other PM companies in the market, and can frame RapidEye as a competitive differentiator for Brian's owner-acquisition pitches — especially since ACME House Company (150+ units, same market) already uses Breezeway and Matterport.",
