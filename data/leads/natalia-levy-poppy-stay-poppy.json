She's likely not the decision-maker for inspection software, but she can route you to Kelly McLean Lewin (COO/CEO) or the property management team (Angela Swan, Kelly Lipscomb). Poppy manages 130+ vacation rental homes, rebranded from McLean Company (est. 1984), runs on Streamline PMS, and has no confirmed inspection platform — real gap for RapidEye. Your play: build rapport, see if she touches turnovers, and get routed to the right ops leader. SoCal connection — you grew up in La Cañada, she's in Palm Springs.",
