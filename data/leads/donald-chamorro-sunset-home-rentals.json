    "context": "Donald Chamorro is the Maintenance Manager at GoldenWest Management / Sunset Home Rentals — he's the one who feels it when a missed issue during turnover becomes an emergency work order, a repeat vendor dispatch, or an after-hours call. He appears to coordinate remotely from Nicaragua, managing a 24/7 maintenance operation across a portfolio that spans San Diego, Phoenix, and Las Vegas (1,000–3,000+ units depending on which page you read). They use AppFolio for long-term and LMPM for vacation rentals but have no known inspection or photo-analysis platform. They're actively expanding into Cabo San Lucas — new country, new vendors, more coordination strain. Sam's angle: works with other San Diego PMs, and if conversation warms up, both have Central America ties (Sam surfed El Salvador recently). Roy True (Director of Ops) is likely the tooling decision-maker — Donald is the downstream pain owner and a path to Roy.",
