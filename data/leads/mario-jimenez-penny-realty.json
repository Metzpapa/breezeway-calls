They run a two-step turnover QC — contracted cleaners then a dedicated inspector after every checkout — but no inspection platform is publicly visible, likely manual. They're actively hiring a Vacation Rental Home Inspector, signaling rapid growth. Sam's angle: SoCal native, works with other San Diego PMs on inspection workflows.",
