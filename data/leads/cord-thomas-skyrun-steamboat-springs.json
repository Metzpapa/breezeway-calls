He controls the operational standards and tech stack that every franchise location runs on. SkyRun is mid-overhaul: they just adopted Track PMS, PriceLabs for pricing, and RemoteLock for access, and they're pushing to add 350 new doors by end of 2025. The brand promises homeowners pre-arrival inspections and proactive maintenance, but local franchise teams are tiny — some locations have just 2 FTEs managing 30-80 units. Sam's skiing connection is a natural icebreaker if it comes up — SkyRun is heavy in ski resort markets and Sam just skied Jackson Hole in January.",
