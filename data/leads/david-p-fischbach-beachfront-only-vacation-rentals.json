    "context": "David Fischbach is CEO/Owner of Beachfront Only Vacation Rentals — 77-85+ oceanfront-only properties in North County San Diego (Oceanside, Carlsbad, Encinitas), operating since 2000. Retired anesthesiologist who served on the Escapia and VRBO boards, so he is deeply plugged into VR industry tech and distribution. The company runs in-house cleaning staff plus dedicated turnover specialists who inspect after every single stay — they already believe in a verification layer, but it is fully manual and labor-intensive on tight same-day turns (10 AM checkout, 4 PM check-in). Tech stack: Track (PMS + guest/owner portals), UpKeep (CMMS), branded guest app with keyless entry. Oceanside just capped non-hosted STR permits at 480 with 455 already taken, and Fischbach has drawn neighborhood and press scrutiny — preventable guest complaints carry outsized regulatory and reputational risk. Sam's SoCal roots and surfing connect naturally to Oceanside beach culture, and the company has no known photo/ops automation platform — RapidEye fills a clear gap on top of their existing inspection workflow.",
