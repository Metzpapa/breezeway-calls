She directly owns turn quality, housekeeping standards, and operational readiness across the portfolio. CBVR runs Track (TravelNet) as their PMS with Atlas for their website — no Breezeway or Matterport detected, so photo review and inspections are likely manual or limited to Track's built-in housekeeping tools. Sam's strongest hook: he works with similar coastal PM operators, is a surfer himself, and the Oregon Coast angle makes this feel natural rather than random.",

But the reality was, especially in peak season with back-to-back turns, nobody had time to actually sit there and scroll through 30 or 40 photos per unit looking for a stain on the couch or a chip in a countertop. Stuff was getting through, guests were finding it, and it was turning into bad reviews and owner phone calls. The photos existed — the problem was nobody could use them fast enough.",
