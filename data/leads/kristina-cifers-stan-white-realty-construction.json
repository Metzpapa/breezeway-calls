Stan White is family-owned (Stan, Susie, and son John White as COO), manages 300+ vacation rentals across multiple OBX offices, and runs a construction arm under one umbrella. PMS and ops platform are unknown. Sam's strongest hook: he's an avid surfer and fisherman who knows OBX beach culture, and he's already working with East Coast PM companies managing similar seasonal inventory. If Kristina can't decide alone, Katherine Giles (General Manager) or John White (COO) are the escalation paths.",
