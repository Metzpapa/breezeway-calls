Retreatia manages ~250 vacation rentals (77% condos) plus HOA/association management, running on TRACK PMS with a dedicated inspection team separate from cleaning. They're actively hiring housekeeping supervisors and owner liaisons — QA capacity is clearly a pressure point. Gregory manages the condo association side, so he's either refereeing owner-vs-rental-ops damage disputes himself or can point you straight to whoever owns turnover inspections (likely Viktorija Hristovska, GM, or Dan Douglas, Director of Association Management). No shared schools or connections with Sam — lead with the ski-market angle (Sam just skied Jackson Hole in January).",
