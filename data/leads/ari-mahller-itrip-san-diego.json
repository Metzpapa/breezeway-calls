He runs turnovers through iTrip's proprietary FlipStream app with local contractor crews — cleaners upload photos, he reviews via a Mission Control dashboard. The operation is relatively new on Airbnb (~1 year, Superhost, ~34 reviews) and still scaling, with promises of no maintenance markups, free light maintenance, and iTrip's Worry Free Guarantee — all of which increase the cost of missed damage. His wife Tanya co-manages day-to-day ops. Sam connection: Sam grew up in LA, surfs Del Mar and Mission Bay regularly, and works with other franchise PM operators in the San Diego market.",
