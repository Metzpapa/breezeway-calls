    "context": "Calling Kristy Doggett — co-owner and manager of iTrip Beaches of Alabama, an iTrip franchise covering Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, and Fort Morgan since 2010. She handles accounting and back-of-house operations, meaning she directly feels the financial impact of missed damage and failed deposit claims. Co-owns with Lynn Humphries who runs front-of-house and reservations. No inspection software confirmed publicly — no Breezeway, no Matterport. Unit count unknown but likely a smaller operation competing in a market with 350-plus unit players like Beachball Properties and Young's Suncoast. Beach properties mean heavy wear from sand, salt air, humidity, and seasonal party crowds. Calling her cell at (251) 747-2146. Strongest connection: Sam works with Gulf Coast vacation rental managers and is a lifelong surfer and fisherman — Gulf Shores is a premier fishing and beach destination.",
