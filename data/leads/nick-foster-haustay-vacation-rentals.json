Licensed CA real estate broker and sits on the Carlsbad Planning Commission, so compliance and owner credibility are core to how he operates. They run Streamline PMS and PriceLabs, have in-house cleaners they call Home Care Specialists, and explicitly promise to inspect after every turnover — but have no known inspection tech platform. They've grown from about 40 to 60+ properties and are investing heavily in direct bookings. Nick is a surfer — that's your strongest personal in.",

The photos were all there — nobody had time to actually go through every single one across sixty homes. And when you're pushing direct bookings the way you guys are, those reviews hit different. We built something that automatically analyzes the turnover photos your team's already taking and flags anything that's off — damage, missing items, staging issues — before the next guest checks in. Would you be open to seeing what that looks like when I'm not cold calling you out of the blue?",
