    "context": "Anthony Fletcher is GM of Midgett Realty — ~500 vacation rentals on Hatteras Island, Outer Banks, NC. He's held the role since 2000, so 25+ years. Unusual background: BS in Industrial Technology from ECU, then managed a sterile products pharmaceutical facility before joining Midgett. He thinks in process control and zero-defect terms. Midgett runs a 100-point inspection checklist, staffs 9 year-round housekeepers scaling to ~200 in peak season, and absorbs in-house maintenance labor under 60 minutes as a 'No Nickel and Diming' owner policy — meaning guest damage they can't prove costs them real money. Their CTO Dennis Robinson is speaking at VRMA 2025 on automation and likely has final say on software. Sam's strongest hook: he's a fisherman and surfer who spends time on Hatteras — and he works with other OBX-area property managers.",

So a guest trashes a couch or stains a rug, and by the time anyone notices, the next guest is already in the house. They can't prove who did it, so the company eats the cost.
